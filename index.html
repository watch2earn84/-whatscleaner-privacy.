    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>Last Updated: December 21, 2024</p>

    <p>This Privacy Policy describes how <strong>WhatsCleaner</strong> ("the App") handles your data. The App is designed as a utility to help users manage and clean WhatsApp media files on their local device.</p>

    <h2>1. Data Collection and Usage</h2>
    <p><strong>Personal Data:</strong> We do NOT collect, store, or transmit any personal identification information (such as names, phone numbers, or email addresses) to any external servers.</p>
    <p><strong>Media Files:</strong> The App requires access to your device's storage to display and delete WhatsApp media (images, videos, and audio). This process happens entirely locally on your device. We never upload your photos or videos to any server.</p>

    <h2>2. Permissions</h2>
    <p>The App requests the following permissions to function:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Storage Access (Scoped Storage/MANAGE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE):</strong> Used exclusively to allow you to view and delete unnecessary files within the WhatsApp media directory.</li>
        <li><strong>Internet:</strong> Used only for basic app functionality and library updates (e.g., Glide image loading).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>The App uses <strong>Google Play Services</strong>. You can find their privacy policy <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy">here</a>.</p>

    <h2>4. Data Retention and Deletion</h2>
    <p>Since we do not collect your data on our servers, we do not "retain" your data. When you delete a file through the App, it is permanently removed from your device storage according to your command.</p>

    <h2>5. Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>This App does not address anyone under the age of 13 and does not knowingly collect personal data from children.</p>

    <h2>6. Contact Us</h2>
    <p>If you have any questions, contact us at: [whatscleaner5@gmail.com]</p>
